# YouTube Discord Bot (Outdated)


## Overview

This is a Discord music bot developed in Fall 2022 using Discord.js v12. It allows users to play YouTube videos and playlists in voice channels, queue songs, and manage playback through commands like `!play` and `!playlist`. The bot utilizes the YouTube Data API and `ytdl-core-discord` for streaming audio.


## ⚠️ Status: No Longer Functional

This bot is currently **outdated and non-functional** due to the following reasons:


1. **Discord.js v12 Deprecation** – The bot was built using Discord.js v12, which is no longer supported. Discord has made API changes that require upgrading to newer versions of Discord.js (v14+).
2. **YouTube Data API Restrictions** – Changes in YouTube's API policies have affected third-party applications, making direct YouTube streaming more difficult.
3. **ytdl-core-discord Deprecation** – The `ytdl-core-discord` library, used for audio streaming, is no longer actively maintaine


## Repository

This repository remains available for reference purposes, but active development has stopped. Feel free to fork and update it if you'd like to modernize the bot.
