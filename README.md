# YouTube Discord Bot (Outdated)


## Overview

This is a Discord music bot developed in Fall 2022 using Discord.js v12. It allows users to play YouTube videos and playlists in voice channels, queue songs, and manage playback through commands like `!play` and `!playlist`. The bot utilizes the YouTube Data API and `ytdl-core-discord` for streaming audio.
